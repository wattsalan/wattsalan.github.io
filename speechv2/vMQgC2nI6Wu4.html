<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h02m42s">In the mid-twentieth century, psychologist Abraham Maslow set out to answer this question</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h02m58s">Which led him to an important discovery: The healthiest and most prosperous among us are those driven by impulses</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h03m05s">Towards self-realization, which (Mazlou) defined as realization</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h04m09s">This requires defining the goal or purpose of our existence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h04m13s">Because as Mazlou pointed out, self-investigators are committed to a life mission</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h04m20s">Once identified, some people sometimes falter, believing that this requires identifying their true passion</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h04m27s">The problem with this approach is that it ignores the fact that passion often comes after skill development</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h04m34s">So if you are not sure about your passions, it is unlikely that you will discover them through thinking alone</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h04m41s">Instead of prolonged delay, it is much better to choose something challenging</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h04m51s">In light of this, planting the idea or setting a goal will not produce results</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h05m03s">It is important to have something to aim for, not because of the external reward that achieving the goal will bring</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h05m10s">Rather, it is because of the transformation that compels us to go through</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h05m15s">Pursuit of a challenging goal requires us to leave our comfort zone to develop new skills, foster self-discipline, and discover</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQgC2nI6Wu4#t=00h05m33s">People often blame their anxiety, depression, fear, or lack of confidence in their abilities for their inability to do productive work.</a>
