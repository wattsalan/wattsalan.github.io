00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m06s">that an individual who all his life long has played the social game</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m13s">then says: "Well, now I've done that, I have assumed this role, I have become identified with tinker, tailer, soldier, sailer, whatever it was ...</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m23s">... but now: 'Who am I?' ... really!</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m26s">In order to find that out I have to go off by myself. Why?</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m31s">Because ... you have a role conception, a mask conception of yourself ...</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m40s">because other people tell you who you are!</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m46s">We are constantly - 
in every social interchange, in the most common remarks - telling other people who they are.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m59s">Everything leads up to that. 
The way I act towards you, the way you act towards me tells me who I am and tells you who you are.</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m09s">For example, you come and sit here listen to me talk.</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m12s">You are by doing that 
telling me I am some kind of a teacher.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m16s">And you're telling yourselves 
that you're some kind of students.</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m20s">And that's only one thing, you see, one little incident.</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m24s">In business every day, in your house work 
and everything you do</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m29s">everybody around you is telling you what you are and who you are by expecting certain behaviour from you</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m37s">which - if you are a reasonable and socially inclined person - you perform, because that's what's expected of you.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m43s">So you are told who you are!</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m45s">See, it's not much fun to be happy and not know it.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m50s">We need a certain resonance. 
Self-consciousness is an echo in our heads ...</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m57s">... an echo of what we do, 
but wouldn't be aware of doing it if there wasn't an echo.</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m04s">When you see yourself in a mirror, 
that mirror is a visual echo of your face.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m10s">And that's why in a room such as this,
it's very comfortable room for me to talk in - 
because it has resonance.</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m19s">And so self-consciousness is neurological resonance.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m25s">Now you know how troublesome resonance can get 
if it's not properly worked out.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m31s">You can get echoes that just won't stop.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m35s">So you go into a great cave somewhere and say: "Hi." And it does: "hi," "hi," "hi," "hi,"</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m44s">That's very confusing. 
Now that's the sort of ? that self-consciousness can get in to ... and we call it anxiety.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m54s">When I keep keep keep thinking: 
"Did I do the right thing?"</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m02s">If I am constantly aware of myself in a kind of anxious, critical way, my resonance becomes too high</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m11s">and so I get confused and jittery.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m16s">But, if you learn that self-consciousness has limits,<br />
that self-awareness cannot possibly enable you 
to be free of making mistakes.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m37s">You can learn to be spontaneous 
in spite of being self-aware ...</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m44s">... and enjoy the echo!</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m50s">And so you can have this sensation, you see,
of total unity with the cosmos ...</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m58s">of the - shall I call it expansion to infinity 
or contraction to infinity - ...</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m04s">... of your identity</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m08s">without forgetting</a>

00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m15s">in other words</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m17s">it doesn't mean that you forget your address, 
telephone number, social security number</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m21s">and the name you were given.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m24s">You remember all that 
and you can play that game when necessary</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m30s">but you know it's a game!</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m35s">So, there is no way - as a matter of fact - 
of escaping from playing these games</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m42s">And the only thing is 
that when you find out, that you are thoroughly selfish</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m51s">you inquire: "What is it? What is the self that I love?"</a>

00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m05s">And you look very closely in to what you feel

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m10s">And you know what you find out?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m43s">And that going together of Self and other is non-duality, that's advaita!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m48s">That is the Self with a capital "S."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m55s">So, through Self one finds deliverance from self.</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m08s">And so finally, we come to the last consideration</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m14s">which is the question</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m52s">is a curious question!</a>
