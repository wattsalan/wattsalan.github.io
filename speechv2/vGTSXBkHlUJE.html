00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m06s">Watts' interest in Eastern philosophy originated during his youth,</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m09s">in which he loved Chinese and Japanese stories, as well as his affinity for Eastern aesthetics.</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m13s">He thought things like light, color and nature</a>

00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m19s">and he wondered what it was that brought these artists to the world</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m22s">could view with such clarity.</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m24s">Watts was born in what is now southeast London and was initially raised as a Christian.</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m28s">However, as Watts grew up,</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m30s">he started the Christian way of understanding and dealing with life</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m34s">less and less clear, and more and more often it raised more questions than answers.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m39s">In Watts' mind, Christianity actually wasn't trying to answer questions like</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m43s">what the true nature of the universe is, what your true self is,</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m46s">what the meaning of life is and how to deal with it.</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m48s">Christianity seemed more interested in studying and keeping history</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m52s">and remained firmly fixed on the idea that there is a tyrannical figure like God</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m56s">who controls everything.</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h01m58s">This idea of ​​an authoritative figure, who controls everything in the universe</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m01s">was both unattractive and illogical to Watts.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m03s">And so, coupled with his growing fondness and curiosity for Eastern aesthetics,</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m07s">he embarked on his journey to Buddhism.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m10s">What drew Watts further into Buddhism was that into Buddhism</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m12s">instead of a tyrannical god who rules everything with a certain intention,</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m17s">is there a universal consciousness,</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m19s">where everything is connected and everything is part of the whole.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m22s">An independent essence of life that follows its own nature without a boss.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m26s">Every object and person is only an expression of this universal nature,</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m30s">that follows itself, for its own sake.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m33s">Watts found this concept to be much more reasonable, humane and useful</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m37s">for experiencing life.</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m38s">When Watts began to research, contemplate and practice these types of Eastern ideas,</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m42s">he discovered that he had found a certain peace and happiness,</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m44s">often regarded as a type of lighting.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m47s">Life became richer, fears diminished, or even disappeared completely</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m51s">and peace and connection with nature flourished.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m54s">This was what Watts wanted to share with the western world,</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h02m56s">people who clearly needed a way out, out or in.</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m02s">With his strikingly diverse background and understanding of both</a>

00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m08s">Watts felt that much of the Western world was deeply alienated and in conflict with itself.</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m13s">Often focused on status, wealth, consumption, being right or being the best.</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m18s">But even someone who is successful by Western standards,</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m21s">often remains unhappy and disconnected from themselves,</a>

00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m26s">The idea that a successful business, a new luxury product,</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m30s">a higher status, a social power or the like could be a solution</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m33s">for human isolation, fear and vulnerability</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m37s">was extremely foolish in Watts' mind.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m39s">It further revealed the Western religious idea of ​​absolute morality</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m43s">and an authoritative God did not really help the Westerner resolve this on their own</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m49s">or to discover the spiritual essence within oneself.</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m51s">Rather, it detaches them from the physical or metaphysical world,</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m55s">by making them a subject of everything rather than a part of everything.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h03m58s">The principles of Zen and Watts classes are very intertwined.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m02s">As humans, we have a very special consciousness</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m05s">that is aware of what it perceives and moreover identifies itself with its consciousness.</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m09s">This self-identification is generally regarded as ego, and by our ego</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m14s">we feel separate from what we perceive.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m17s">If there is an I that perceives then I am not what I perceive</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m21s">then my inner life must be separated from my outside world.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m24s">Watts often refers to this as being an ego in a shell of skin.</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m29s">In Zen and Watson's teachings, however, this concept is not only incorrect,</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m34s">but it is also the cause of alienation, fear, suffering and hostility.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m39s">Knowing we'll die, things will change,</a>

00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m46s">when we link our sense of self to our body,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSXBkHlUJE#t=00h04m53s">One of the most fundamental principles in the teachings of Zen and Watts</a>
