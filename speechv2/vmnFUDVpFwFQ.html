<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m00s">What do you wish for? What makes you itch? What kind of situation do you like?</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m10s">Let's assume, I do this often in student career guidance, and she comes to me and says, 'Well, we're out of college and we have no clue what we want to do.</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m22s">So I always ask this question, What would you like to do if the money is no object? How do you really enjoy spending your life?</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m34s">Well, it's amazing and as a result of our kind of educational system, crowds of students say OK, we want to be painters and we want to be poets and we'd like to be writers, but as everyone knows you can't make any money that way.</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m47s">Or someone else saying ok, I'd like to live a life outside the doors and ride horses. Did you say you want to teach in a riding school? Let's go through with it. what do you want to do?</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m58s">When we finally get to something, the individual who says he really wants to do, I will tell him: You can do it and forget the money, because,</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m11s">If you say that getting money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time.</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m21s">You have to do the things that I do not like to do in order to live, and that is to go on doing the things you do not like to do, which is stupid.</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m30s">Better for a short life filled with what you want to do than a long life spent in a miserable way.</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m37s">After all, if you really like what you're doing, no matter what it is, you can eventually turn on - you could eventually become a master of it.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m48s">It's the only way to become a master of something, to really be with it. Then you'll be able to get good fees for whatever. So don't worry too much.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m58s">This everyone - is a person interested in everything, anything he can be interested in, you will find others will.</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h02m05s">But it is totally stupid to spend your time doing things you do not like, in order to continue spending things that you do not like, do those things you do not like and teach our children to walk the same path.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h02m18s">We see what we do, is we are raising children and teaching them to live the same kind of life that we are.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h02m25s">Perhaps they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by raising their children to bring their children to do the same thing, so whoever rushes everything, vomiting has never happened there.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h02m38s">Thus, therefore, it is very important to consider this issue. What do I desire?</a>
