<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h04m40s">time we may need people who are full of interest&nbsp;

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h04m46s">at another time we may need people who explore&nbsp;

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h05m02s">so you see here again the&nbsp;
problem comes out in genetics&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h05m06s">we do not really know how to&nbsp;

00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h05m35s">is chickenpox and those&nbsp;

00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h05m46s">so you kill the bug well then&nbsp;
you find you got real problems&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h05m52s">because you have to introduce some bugs to kill&nbsp;
the bug it's like bringing rabbits into australia&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h05m59s">and that starts going all over the place and&nbsp;
getting out of hand but then you think well&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h06m03s">now wait a minute it wasn't the bugs in the blood&nbsp;
there are bugs all over the place what was wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegl1BZ-0tI#t=00h06m08s">with this person that his blood system suddenly&nbsp;
