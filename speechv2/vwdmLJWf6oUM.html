00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h00m15s">Earned last time, now generally belongs to 3 so we usually think that</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h00m23s">Now, we have looked at suffering and happiness. Now, from a Buddhist standpoint, that kind of suffering and behavior that the third class experiences</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h00m32s">Said in a word it feels like p</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h00m39s">In addition to freezing quickly, it was reflected in the number of feelings that could be like this in China, but this feeling is what we now experience when we encounter something</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h00m53s">Well, if it’s emotional and emotional, it’s like this.</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h01m01s">I am satisfied with that basic thing, or I am satisfied with the second thing, and I am so happy that I feel satisfied now</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h01m13s">It is usually expressed as happiness and feelings of happiness It is unsatisfactory to be dissatisfied because something is unsatisfactory</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h01m21s">Now it's called suffering and it's a painful feeling. It's neither annoying nor a pleasant feeling, a feeling of not being happy.</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h01m30s">Now, I talked about three things. So now, the suffering and behavioral suffering that I usually feel at 3 cows</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h01m38s">Feelings are called suffering, and now hospital 1 feelings or feelings of happiness are what ordinary people feel as happiness.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h01m47s">Now, this is the suffering and movement from the perspective of the world. So in a word, the suffering and the luck spoken in the world</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h01m56s">Well, basically, it's a feeling. Well, it's a feeling.</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h02m06s">I have a feeling of happiness and peace, but am I happy now?</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h02m12s">With happiness, you can now feel and experience this perception. You can see it now.</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h02m20s">But now today, this is just that common</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h02m27s">Awareness of the suffering and happiness that we usually experience in Problem 3</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h02m36s">After the Buddha gained enlightenment, he realized that what is suffering is what is happiness.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h02m45s">Seek through and when you realize it, ask for spring, and be happy with the introduction to now look at in the second generation</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h02m54s">It would be best if the suffering and happiness that I saw after the Buddha had no difference</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h03m00s">Well, it’s very easy for us to understand</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h03m05s">It may be very easy to understand, but unfortunately, after the Buddha realized yes and truth,</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h03m16s">Suffering and happiness, and Bucheon will be, the suffering and happiness viewed from the standpoint are a little different.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h03m25s">That's the biggest problem now, and because we don't know it from the standpoint of the truth, these problems arise.</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h03m35s">Oh, that’s why you have grasped it. So today, from the last time, the suffering and happiness that the Buddha sees</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h03m45s">Uh, so already, let’s take a look at what suffering and happiness from the standpoint of truth do something</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h03m55s">First, uh, now, in a word, we feel the suffering and happiness of the world.</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h04m03s">If you keep away from the feeling you experience while meeting, the suffering and happiness that the Buddha says</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h04m10s">Uh, beyond that simple feeling</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h04m15s">It's very important to understand that this is a trait trait attribute</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h04m26s">Ordinary people now say that we are Goseongje in Buddhism. 4 Sungjae The first of the four sacred truths is now</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h04m34s">Suffering n the sacred truth is called the Goseongje</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h04m42s">One of the reasons people get confused is good because of this terminology problem</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h04m48s">In general, we say that the term "painfulness" has risen quickly. Inje</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h04m55s">Because the term “suffering” feels painful and I usually understand it.</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h05m05s">When the Buddha says that everything in this world is suffering, I am happy now, but why is suffering?</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h05m13s">I’m happy, so now I have to ask myself,</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h05m20s">It happens because you speak a little differently from the concept I usually think</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h05m29s">But now, when this Buddha speaks of this suffering, the sacred truth of that suffering, the suffering</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h05m36s">In the everyday sense, it has a much deeper meaning than this suffering, so now I use the same terms well for 9 minutes, but these two</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h05m47s">It can be very confusing to understand this Buddhism if you do not understand that the meaning is a little different.</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h05m55s">So when I first translated the winner into English, it was painful</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h06m04s">I prospered as a surfer ring. I use it as a surfer, and surf is now called a pring.</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h06m11s">Is really literally like pain, suffering, but nowadays, this</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h06m20s">When translating something like this, I changed the translation a little to say that I have more on set piece factory. I am dissatisfied with the translation.</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h06m28s">Ramen is confusing because we don’t know why</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h06m38s">I just made a skylight on this word, so this is clearly the suffering of a happy back.</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h06m47s">Uh yeah, understanding Buddhism may have difficulty responding</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h06m52s">So, today, I'll go into a little more detail about that part. So, now, take care of yourself in a word and let me explain it in detail</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h07m02s">The suffering and happiness the Buddha said is not just a feeling, it is a characteristic</a>
00:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h07m09s">It’s good to understand that it’s a property. It’s good to understand that all of these properties are properties.</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h07m18s">The flesh that you have The original, very intrinsic appearance of the phenomenon, the actual appearance, the actual appearance, etc. For example, the end</a>
00:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h07m31s">There are cases where a person who looks very good actually looks like a scammer</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h07m39s">In the end, it’s better, yes, a normal person looks very fine</a>
00:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h07m45s">When you look inside, people who are good at cheating and lying and doing this are different from the one you didn't hear from now.</a>
00:07:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h07m57s">Well, like that, the phenomena we now encounter</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h08m02s">In the end, it's just what we habitually perceive, and the appearance it actually has is a little different.</a>
00:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h08m11s">So, it can be said that the characteristic of the phenomenon is actually the characteristic of Onsung.</a>
00:08:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h08m17s">So it’s very important to understand that the Buddha’s saying I’m not a feeling of acceptance,</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h08m25s">So, in fact, in the scriptures now, the word happiness is not used very much. Rather, it refers to the ending of suffering and suffering.</a>
00:08:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h08m38s">So, rather than saying happiness, there are a lot of words that are sold out for dogs</a>
00:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h08m44s">So what it means is that now, if you know what suffering is, that suffering is completely the state of somen is happiness.</a>
00:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h08m56s">So what the Buddha is doing, so understand this part a little, so now, what does this Hanran mean, the happiness that the Buddha is talking about?</a>
00:08:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h09m07s">So, the meaning of cessation of suffering or happiness is a little clearer.</a>
00:09:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h09m17s">Just phenomenally, even if this is happiness now, what it has and that it has any possibility of suffering again is itself</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h09m29s">The Buddha said that we did not see it as happiness, so the happiness that the Buddha said is not just a temporary happiness,</a>
00:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h09m39s">Happiness This is the possibility that the oddity of my clothes is completely gone</a>
00:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h09m45s">That's uh, perfect happiness This is now the definition of happiness.</a>
00:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h09m53s">Even if things are happy, happiness can change again. Not like that, but now complete happiness.</a>
00:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h10m03s">The property itself has no property at all, which is likely to cause suffering</a>
00:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h10m09s">So now, instead of the word happiness, I expressed that suffering is extinguished.</a>
00:10:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h10m18s">So, I saw the state of being completely extinguished without the possibility of happening again.</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h10m25s">If not, you saw it as suffering. So that means that it is now generally the suffering and happiness you see in those three.</a>
00:10:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h10m35s">The meaning of suffering and happiness that the Buddha sees is different. That’s the most important thing now.</a>
00:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h10m44s">So, now, what does Buddha Fisher say that the meaning of suffering and happiness is much more strict than what we usually mean?</a>
00:10:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h10m56s">It’s much dear, it’s closer to the essence, so it’s good to see it like this</a>
00:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h11m05s">So, then, it means suffering and happiness now as seen from the 3rd, and now the Buddha asks for that suffering and happiness that the Buddha sees.</a>
00:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h11m15s">How the meaning differs, one by one, in the secular meaning of suffering and happiness, and now, a little bit of the painful happiness that the Buddha said.</a>
00:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h11m26s">If you look at it while comparing it, I think it will help you understand the ringing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h11m32s">First of all, I said that the happiness of a dog farm in the world is a feeling as I said before.</a>
00:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h11m39s">There are three kinds of feelings and feelings of mine</a>
00:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h11m48s">In the middle, the painful feeling was comfortable with suffering, and now I feel happy or hospitalized.</a>
00:11:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h11m53s">Uh painful when it comes to happiness 2 We understand that it's now Buddha</a>
00:11:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h12m01s">From the perspective of the Buddha, let's look at how it is understood</a>
00:12:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h12m08s">First of all, it’s true that everyone perceives suffering as suffering.</a>
00:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h12m15s">It’s not difficult to understand school. It’s natural to see the feeling of suffering as suffering.</a>
00:12:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h12m21s">Feelings of physical distress, pain, or something like the weather is hot or hungry.</a>
00:12:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h12m31s">Since everyone perceives it as suffering, there is not much room for objection</a>
00:12:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h12m39s">It's very easy to understand. Also, because everyone perceives suffering mentally as suffering,</a>
00:12:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h12m51s">Because all these things are widely recognized as suffering, the painful feeling is painful, of course, the painful feeling</a>
00:12:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h12m59s">It has a trait to suffering. This in itself gives suffering. Apart from these traits, the painful feeling itself</a>
00:12:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h13m06s">Because pain is so, if you dare to do this for 9 minutes</a>
00:13:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h13m14s">It turns into 2 car 2 car, which is itself 2 car</a>
00:13:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h13m19s">Tuca Gin de affliction, which in itself means suffering itself is suffering. It means suffering that is pain.</a>
00:13:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h13m30s">This is easy to understand. Then, if you go a little further from here, it is happiness in the bird.</a>
00:13:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h13m40s">Understanding, that happiness, is what the Buddha sees as suffering.</a>
00:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h13m50s">So, it would be nice to take a closer look at this part, but it feels calm</a>
00:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h13m57s">Now, there are two feelings of happiness. Oh, if you look at what a happy feeling is, the rest of the feelings of calm are also</a>
00:13:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h14m07s">Therefore, since it is easy to understand, let’s look at the feeling of happiness first, and then we will also look at the feeling of being in the hospital.</a>
00:14:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h14m18s">Now, there are two kinds of happy feelings. Right, yes, now there is a feeling of happiness in the sensuous desire and the feeling of happiness from others</a>
00:14:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h14m26s">I said, but now this is the most difficult part for people to understand</a>
00:14:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h14m32s">When it comes to worldly, everyone thinks that their wife is happy if they feel happy.</a>
00:14:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h14m38s">But now the Buddha seems to be happy for no reason, even Kim's avenue is not perfect.</a>
00:14:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h14m47s">The property itself, which also has this, is incomplete p, and it itself has the property of suffering.</a>
00:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h14m58s">So this feeling of happiness seems to be happiness when we feel it, but when will this disappear and turn into suffering?</a>
00:14:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h15m07s">I can't guarantee this. It's uncertain. While taking this insight, you saw this as suffering. This is now secular and what the Buddha saw.</a>
00:15:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h15m18s">It’s a big difference. So, understanding this part is now the suffering of the world and the happy,</a>
00:15:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h15m25s">It can be said that it is very important for the Buddha to understand the difference between machine marriage and happiness.</a>
00:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h15m31s">So, first, I’ll divide the two a little and look at it.</a>
00:15:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h15m38s">Ping If you feel happy, you are happy with your sensual desire</a>
00:15:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h15m44s">After that, I told you that there are five things next to the bus. First, the sensuous desire and happiness is the Buddha.</a>
00:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h15m54s">As I said, this itself is sweet as if it’s uh now happiness</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h16m02s">Because there is always an obsession with this, the happiness of this sensual desire is surely this</a>
00:16:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h16m11s">Uh, it causes suffering. Dissatisfaction. So this itself is sweet.</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h16m19s">There are many, so this seems like happiness, but in reality,</a>
00:16:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h16m24s">That’s why the Buddha said this is a low happiness</a>
00:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h16m31s">I said that it’s impossible happiness. So, in this sensual desire, happiness itself</a>
00:16:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h16m38s">Oh, paradoxically, it is a concept that only changers seem happy</a>
00:16:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h16m43s">It’s a pain like happiness. It’s sweet in itself, but it’s like eating some sweet magic that contains poison.</a>
00:16:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h16m53s">It is sweet, but after that, due to the oil well being pulled, the effect is much greater only after the storm.</a>
00:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h17m01s">So, this is a lot more suffering than happiness than it is because of suffering. So this is ah suffering. It has the characteristics of suffering.</a>
00:17:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h17m11s">So this is a little uh, the easiest way for people to forget</a>
00:17:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h17m22s">This is because it is the happiness that comes to fulfilling the desire caused by a lot of sensuous farming.</a>
00:17:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h17m28s">There is a wonder that the night view of the Buddha is different from his clothes.</a>
00:17:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h17m33s">Here, as a metaphor of about 10 squares and 11, it is explained why this is an attribute of suffering, not happiness.</a>
00:17:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h17m41s">There are a few of them, but I will introduce you to the first.</a>
00:17:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h17m48s">If you sleep as a metaphor by feeding happiness to this sensual desire, the ratio of the baby [ __ ] change What is the baby baby? Why did you use the ratio to the dividend?</a>
00:17:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h17m58s">If we say what kind of bone level we did now, there are bones, but after all the flesh is applied, the flesh will be floating in that dark part?</a>
00:17:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h18m07s">Oh, if you think of a bone that has only the flesh of a root attached to it, the meat smells like it</a>
00:18:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h18m19s">It's a small amount in a sigh, but because it has meat, it has meat</a>
00:18:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h18m27s">But I don’t have anything to eat when I’m trying to eat it. So this smells like this, but when I try to eat it</a>
00:18:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h18m34s">Black 20,000 g Actually, it’s something that doesn’t stop hunger. I can’t eat it.</a>
00:18:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h18m42s">So, looking at the smell, it seems that this will completely satisfy your hunger, but in his ratio, he has nothing to eat.</a>
00:18:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h18m53s">It seems like happiness, but just because we experience it like this does not make our hearts very happy, it is rather empty</a>
00:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h19m03s">This happiness is empty, and rather, the dissatisfaction is greater</a>
00:19:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h19m08s">It's a percentage of the thing that causes more suffering. Actually, people will have a lot of that experience.</a>
00:19:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h19m16s">When you play all night and enter the house, there is something like something empty and something lonely rather than just being full of happiness, and celebrities are also just like summer dimmers.</a>
00:19:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h19m28s">So I’m so cheered and I’m really happy when I’m on that stage, but when the performance is over and I go behind the model,</a>
00:19:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h19m35s">It is said that there are many cases where people feel a park that cannot be said, so in a word, that state of mind is empty happiness.</a>
00:19:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h19m45s">This is really a pain like happiness.</a>
00:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h19m53s">After that, the impressive metaphor is that happiness is like a chunk of meat to sensual desire.</a>
00:19:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h20m02s">Now, if a song is dropped, a bird will bite it and fly like this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h20m24s">There is no way to avoid this pain, as this biting law does not let go</a>
00:20:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h20m33s">So, why is this freezing and sensational desire happiness?</a>
00:20:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h20m43s">The thing is based on the will of the target. Something we are going through with the target, and the desired target has been proposed.</a>
00:20:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h20m52s">Well, today we are going to vote, so it’s election day 2</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h21m07s">Then, since they won't be in that position, they have no choice but to hold the opponents and accuse them or attack them in order to occupy each other.</a>
00:21:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h21m16s">The reality is that I cannot escape from such publicity unless I leave the seat of the congressman.</a>
00:21:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h21m22s">So this is the fact that we now have any profits and money</a>
00:21:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h21m27s">To get the honor I want, I have to win the competition. So, to say happiness to this sensuous desire is the will of the object, and I refer to that object as darkness.</a>
00:21:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h21m39s">Because of the happiness they get from being satisfied, however, the targets that ordinary people want are all similar.</a>
00:21:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h21m46s">So this is something that you have to constantly compete and struggle</a>
00:21:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h21m52s">Oh, I don't let go of this obsession, it's hard to get away from competition or quarrels or things like this</a>
00:21:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h21m59s">So this sensational desire happiness is proportional to the bird's biting and flying away.</a>
00:21:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h22m06s">That’s why I emptied this in a chunk of meat</a>

00:23:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h23m20s">So uh, uh, actually, what we say sensuous happiness is money</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h26m59s">Another of the greatest humor to this sensuous desire is that it degrades us. It does not make people grow in that state.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h28m06s">Developing this to become too enslaved to this or to fall in love with it is not conducive to our improvement ah.</a>
00:28:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h28m15s">That’s why you said this, this is the nature that the Buddha has in this sensuous desire itself is suffering.</a>
00:28:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h28m24s">Now, of course, since the sensual desires are neither happy nor eternal.</a>
00:28:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h28m31s">There are attributes, but there are a lot of bigger decisions than that, so now I've emphasized this to explain it.</a>
00:28:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h28m40s">But now, here is one thing I want to talk about in the book Now, is happiness to sensational desire unconditionally bad?</a>
00:28:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h28m50s">So it’s a bit difficult to say this way. Of course, this sensuous desire is happiness.</a>
00:28:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h29m02s">They try to get what they want and enjoy it in a legitimate way</a>
00:29:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h29m10s">The Buddha didn’t criticize it. But I’m so obsessed with this sensual desire,</a>
00:29:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h29m18s">It's important to understand now that the side effects of being a slave are too great.</a>
00:29:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h29m26s">That is why we understand and understand exactly what this decision has or the problem with this sensory desire and</a>
00:29:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h29m34s">If we understand that sensuous desire has a lot more of an attribute to suffering, we don't cling to it, we just stick to it even if we experience it.</a>
00:29:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h29m44s">This can be said to be a big advantage now</a>
00:29:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h29m50s">For example, the Buddha means something delicious, but you can eat it without being obsessed with it. So now that's possible</a>
00:29:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h30m00s">First, is happiness in this sensational desire? Is there a lot of decisions like this?</a>
00:30:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h30m11s">The borrowed item is not mine, it is only borrowed, and so it is caused by corruption.</a>
00:30:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h30m18s">Happiness, not suffering, has a lot more elements.</a>
00:30:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h30m25s">If so, now that we are usually practitioners now grasping and insight into those shortcomings and shortcomings of happiness that these sensual desires have.</a>
00:30:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h30m35s">From this, the night of pursuing some happiness escapes and seeks the happiness of others.</a>
00:30:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h30m43s">Last time, I explained, but this burden really has a lot more elements of happiness than happiness and much less suffering elements.</a>
00:30:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h30m53s">So, usually my practitioners go out with the happiness of others.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h32m16s">It's an unclean pleasure, and the wealth is young, so we shouldn't move and support it. This is something we should throw away and be afraid of it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h32m25s">If we fall out of this desire, we have to be afraid because it may lead us to corruption.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h32m31s">So, if this understanding is the basis, if we take off based on that understanding, we can build happiness.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h33m23s">It must be that happiness will not fall in those sensual desires.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h34m30s">Obviously, it looks like a ham that we need to develop and it is a desirable happiness, but the Buddha said this in the last time, but the happiness of these three others</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h34m42s">Uh, we don't feed meat and see what we need to develop. It's happiness that we don't need to fear.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h39m04s">First of all, even after pursuing happiness, even this was formed.</a>
00:39:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h39m12s">Because it was a deferred law that was purposely formed by working hard in this way we intended, even this is impermanent and extinguished.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h40m12s">It is the second time to look at it like this. So, there is an attribute to the sensational desire to escape and suffering, and to the happiness of others.</a>
00:40:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h40m21s">Understanding that suffering has its properties, in other words, feeling happy is suffering.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h41m12s">After all, suffering has an attribute, so the feeling of happiness itself is suffering.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h41m19s">Understanding this part is actually a very important point in understanding suffering in Buddhism</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h41m28s">But now, the happiness of others is now uh, of course, this is suffering.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h41m37s">It is the pain that has remained, but nevertheless, the happiness of others on this bus</a>
00:41:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h41m42s">If we understand that this is suffering, even this is suffering, and if we wear it well and use others' things without being obsessed with it,</a>
00:41:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h41m54s">We pray for a very useful mushroom happiness that can be used very well toward extinguishing and losing trouble.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h42m04s">In fact, the reason why we say about 8 to 8 is the middle degree is out of our sensational desires, but this is also painful</a>
00:42:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h42m14s">It is not a very good thing that we can get away from ourselves by practicing on the basis of the performance ball of happiness of others.</a>
00:42:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h42m25s">Also, because it is the basis, if you wear it and lead the practice based on the happiness of others, you will not only be happy in the middle of the practice, but also</a>
00:42:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h42m36s">The first and the middle are happy, and as I said before, there is no selection based on happiness after this bus.</a>
00:42:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h42m46s">After obtaining, even the selection is impermanent. Even this, by insight that suffering is not mine</a>
00:42:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h42m53s">It’s also a very good weapon that can abandon all obsessions and eliminate anguish.</a>
00:42:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h43m01s">So the happiness of others is uh</a>
00:43:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h43m08s">This in itself has the nature of suffering, but if you make good use of this person's happiness, it will become a very good weapon to relieve suffering.</a>
00:43:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h43m18s">So now this itself is an action that the Buddha should develop and our noble</a>
00:43:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h43m26s">It’s happiness, and it’s like this. This is the happiness that we need to develop now, but only one</a>
00:43:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h43m33s">It is not advisable to be obsessed with this, too. Obsessing makes it corrupt again, and this makes it difficult to practice.</a>
00:43:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h43m40s">Because I do not obsess over this, but if I take advantage of happiness because I am pretty, while insight that it is painful to pursue the happiness of this bus</a>
00:43:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h43m49s">This is the decisive mosquito in knowing through the reality of existence, and it can eliminate all suffering due to the attraction</a>
00:43:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h44m00s">It becomes the basis for practicing meditation. This is also the greatest advantage to the happiness of others.</a>
00:44:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h44m06s">So, I see this as a dog, but I see it as suffering. Even if I look at it, if I use it like this without being obsessed with it, this is another good advantage.</a>
00:44:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h44m16s">Because there is a Buddha, this is a happiness that must be developed and a noble happiness</a>
00:44:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h44m21s">Oh, it’s happiness that you don’t need to be afraid of.</a>
00:44:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h44m29s">So now, uh, we see it as happiness in the general secular committee that we see as happiness</a>
00:44:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h44m38s">Happiness or escape from a sense of desire is an essential point of truth.</a>
00:44:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h44m43s">From the standpoint, suffering has an attribute, so even this feeling of happiness is suffering. This is how the Buddha gave insight.</a>
00:44:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h44m57s">Suffering is especially in the pain that comes from this feeling of happiness when it disappears.</a>
00:44:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h45m07s">So, this is the pain that comes from disappearing</a>
00:45:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h45m15s">It is said that it is painful, so this is usually called it, and that painful feeling is that the song itself is painful, so see or 2</a>
00:45:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h45m26s">2 The place where Ka is suffering If you say that it is ordinary suffering, then this feeling of happiness remains in the upper part of the body and recovers from Tuka.</a>
00:45:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h45m34s">When this collapses, it disappears by disappearing. Because it has no choice but to disappear, it comes out.</a>
00:45:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h45m43s">The feeling of being calm is not that people are bothered or happy</a>
00:45:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h45m52s">That’s why, but this is also made under conditions. It’s a feeling created by contact.</a>
00:45:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h45m57s">Because of this, even this is bound to disappear, and this peace is especially comfortable because it is the suffering that has been formed.</a>
00:45:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h46m07s">Because it is formed and formed by being formed, it is expressed as rinsing because of that, which is essentially formed.</a>
00:46:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h46m18s">As a medium, so it turns into a twin karado car.</a>
00:46:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h46m23s">So anyway, if you look at these three things now, uh, the painful feeling itself is suffering. This is a secular view</a>
00:46:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h46m32s">The Buddha's opinion is not different. To say that a feeling of distress is suffering, however, is a feeling of happiness or suffering.</a>
00:46:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h46m39s">In the case of a feeling of serenity, the world understands this as happiness, but the Buddha</a>
00:46:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h46m46s">This in itself is viewed as suffering, and this in itself has the attribute of suffering.</a>
00:46:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h46m53s">This is the difference. Because there are so many graveyards according to the desire of the sensational desire, it is seen with suffering.</a>
00:46:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h47m00s">The naked Amen's neck is a lot shorter than the 6 elements of happiness, but this itself is bound to disappear.</a>
00:47:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h47m07s">Uh, he has an attribute that cannot but change, and at this time he viewed it as suffering.</a>
00:47:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h47m14s">Plain feeling is called suffering because it is formed again. So, in conclusion, this feeling itself</a>
00:47:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h47m24s">When I see the feeling that what I see as suffering is what the Buddha sees from the Buddha’s view</a>
00:47:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h47m34s">The feeling itself is suffering. You saw it like this.</a>
00:47:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h47m41s">Because feeling itself is suffering, in the end, when we say that suffering is extinguished, the fact that feeling does not occur is actually</a>
00:47:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h47m49s">You can see all the cessation of true suffering. So, the Buddha has organized this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h47m56s">Yes, I said, "Let's spread it," but look in front of page 61 in this book.</a>

00:48:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h48m20s">Intestinal stiffness 5 Painted or swollen. This method you mentioned is briefly explained.</a>
00:48:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h48m31s">So, if you look here, whatever you feel about what you said in this competition</a>

00:48:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h48m50s">There is an attribute of suffering. This is not simply caused by the feeling of suffering.</a>
00:48:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h48m57s">Have so we actually now</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h49m03s">Oh, all this feeling has an attribute to suffering, whether it is happiness or no pain.</a>
00:49:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h49m11s">So from the viewpoint of this Buddha, the feeling itself is dog-playing The feeling itself is attributed to suffering.</a>
00:49:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h49m21s">Because you can see it like this, even if you feel a feeling asking what effect it has, if the feeling itself is incomplete and has an attribute to suffering</a>
00:49:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h49m32s">No matter what kind of feeling you experience, you don’t cling to it</a>
00:49:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h49m39s">So even now, even this happy feeling, when you get an insight that the feeling itself is suffering,</a>
00:49:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h49m48s">When the feeling of the Korean language is not swayed and the feeling is not tied, the phlegm will urinate when something is gone</a>
00:49:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h49m58s">Because on what condition does phlegm work</a>
00:49:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h50m01s">Because the Buddha said that this phlegm works on condition of the feeling. When we experience the feeling of happiness, we hope it will last forever.</a>
00:50:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h50m11s">Phlegm of existence arises. When you experience painful feelings,</a>
00:50:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h50m17s">I wish I didn’t have this, but it’s not this feeling.</a>
00:50:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h50m23s">So, because phlegm occurs as a condition of this feeling, if we do not obsess over the feeling and do not inform the end of the feeling, phlegm does not occur and then</a>
00:50:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h50m33s">Because of Lee Kun-ho, we can know it or not. It means that enlightenment can happen. So, who is this representative person?</a>
00:50:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h50m40s">There is a private existence A clear insight that the feeling of being honored with this private is suffering</a>
00:50:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h50m46s">By doing so, you can experience the feeling without being tied to the feeling when the feeling comes out of suffering</a>
00:50:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h50m53s">By doing so, you know what you experience, because you haven't been, so now you know, no, no matter what feeling you experience, that's the end</a>
00:50:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h51m01s">I can experience it without being able to experience it. Because the sputum disappears, I feel this now.</a>
00:51:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h51m10s">Because I think, I'll feel it. The feeling itself is suffering. Then, if we go, don't even feel happy.</a>
00:51:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h51m18s">Are you saying that you should live like that rock or a tree or a wooden stone like a still life? This is not it. We have a clear insight that this feeling itself is a dog.</a>
00:51:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h51m28s">If you look at the front of page 64, you can feel the feeling without being tied to that feeling.</a>
00:51:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h51m40s">From there, the Buddha's teaching tells us how we now react to the feelings of the now-Aran beings.</a>
00:51:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h51m51s">It’s a Kyung named Young. Let’s read it together. If he feels happy, he’s not tied to it.</a>
00:51:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h51m58s">Feeling it When he feels painful, he feels it without being tied to it</a>
00:51:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h52m06s">When he feels a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant, he feels it without being tied to it.</a>
00:52:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h52m13s">This means that people who have a clear insight into feelings are not bound by any feelings they experience.</a>
00:52:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h52m21s">But how are we usually? When we experience a feeling of happiness, we are obsessed with size and greed is transmitted.</a>
00:52:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h52m31s">Potential arises, and the feeling of calm is potential arising from foolishness because you don't know what it is</a>
00:52:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h52m37s">It’s easy, so because of this feeling all the potential tendencies arise and no sputum</a>
00:52:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h52m43s">Because it happens, if you have a clear insight into this feeling, you will not be fooled by that feeling.</a>
00:52:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h52m50s">We usually use feelings, but if you don’t get fooled by this feeling and experience that feeling</a>
00:52:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h52m59s">Potential match When greed or anger is extinguished, this is the extinguishment of suffering because the latent volume is completely extinguished rather than the window of a house called this phlegm.</a>
00:52:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h53m08s">That's why when we say that this simple feeling of happiness is suffering itself, it means that we are negative or something pessimistic.</a>
00:53:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h53m21s">No, we don't clearly attribute the nature of this feeling to our insights,</a>
00:53:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h53m29s">If you say that you are not tied, then even if you feel it, we experience happiness and suffering, but it does not end there.</a>
00:53:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h53m38s">Usually, when we experience feelings of distress, we hate Eid and this can make us angry and dislike it. If we feel happy</a>
00:53:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h53m47s">Because I'm obsessed with that, I'm going to explore the house again This is a house where the greed that sticks to it will develop again It's easy, but without that</a>
00:53:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h53m56s">It just means that it can be some kind of free state of mind like this, not tied, twisted to experience.</a>
00:53:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h54m04s">So this feeling itself is affliction, so whatever you feel, as you said, this insight that reaches into suffering is actually</a>
00:54:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h54m15s">It can be said that this is a very important insight for us to understand the stator among the Four Truths.</a>
00:54:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h54m22s">So, after understanding this way, in the end, what will be, the feeling of happiness itself is not tied to the feeling of pain, so there is no phlegm</a>
00:54:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h54m32s">It can be Ramadan. So, after living like this, Aran dies.</a>
00:54:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h54m39s">Because there is no sputum, if there is sputum, you are born and no balhae is born.</a>
00:54:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h54m44s">So, when phlegm is no longer born, the feeling will disappear.</a>
00:54:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h54m50s">I have a feeling because how do you know that we are now feeling</a>
00:54:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h54m58s">It’s like this when the body meets an external target. Give me what is it like in 12 games?</a>
00:54:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h55m05s">Since there is a body, there is an initial contact, and when it is early, feelings arise.</a>
00:55:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h55m11s">So this feeling has to exist. Athlete's foot feels in the water.</a>
00:55:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h55m18s">So, there is this being, there is existence, there is a body. Normal human beings have a body called "B1" and this body is a color.</a>
00:55:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h55m27s">Cancer is in the early stages and it is said that when you meet the subject 1 6, that feeling occurs there.</a>
00:55:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h55m34s">What happens to that black feeling is that this feeling that happens in the end feels because there is existence</a>
00:55:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h55m41s">The story of feelings is extinguished because we are born and feelings arise to beings that are born.</a>
00:55:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h55m51s">So it’s like saying that you are not born.</a>
00:55:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h56m01s">This means that the feeling arises while doing this, so what happens when you expand the words that this feeling is painful</a>
00:56:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h56m09s">The being born has no choice but to use the feeling, because this feeling itself is an attribute to suffering.</a>
00:56:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h56m17s">In other words, there is no possibility that suffering will not occur when this creature that exists itself exists.</a>
00:56:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h56m27s">It is a story that it cannot be avoided. Kelp exists and cannot completely escape from suffering.</a>
00:56:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h56m33s">The fact that it is not a feeling is that the feeling itself has an attribute to suffering. So this is directly</a>
00:56:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h56m42s">So the feeling means suffering, the feeling itself is suffering, and the existence itself</a>
00:56:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h56m49s">It is not an exaggeration to say that the meaning of suffering is actually the same. So, those who have insight into that this feeling itself is suffering</a>
00:56:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h56m58s">It is possible to gain insight into what is painful, and in the end, because this is an insight into sexual sin, anyone who sees this will lose the phlegm about it.</a>
00:56:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h57m06s">It’s obvious that the phlegm is dying once in a while</a>
00:57:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h57m10s">Now the suffering is extinguished So this feeling itself is suffering</a>
00:57:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h57m17s">Understanding is actually the same as understanding the sin of the high priest, so in the end, the being born has no choice but to experience the feeling, and the feeling itself is a pain.</a>
00:57:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h57m30s">At times, the existence itself is understood as a sin of suffering, and because of the phlegm of the liver, the Buddha</a>
00:57:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h57m38s">The person who has said that he is born now, but has clarified that this feeling itself is affliction, the phlegm disappears because there can be no phlegm to the feeling</a>
00:57:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h57m48s">Then, when the phlegm disappears, the grouping system will be launched.</a>
00:57:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h57m54s">So if the sputum was a sleeve, all suffering would be extinguished. So</a>
00:57:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h58m02s">This feeling, the feeling itself, is suffering, and the somen of the feeling is complete happiness. This taste is born.</a>
00:58:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h58m12s">It can be said that escaping from the bond of no longer being born is complete happiness, and in fact, the same thing can be prepared.</a>
00:58:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h58m23s">As you said, since you know nothing called happiness spirit</a>
00:58:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h58m29s">If you look at the bottom of the verse on page 62, is very short. Reborn is painful, and unborn is happiness.</a>
00:58:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h58m38s">There is also an expression like this. So, the feeling of the being born has no choice but to experience the feeling and suffering because of it</a>
00:58:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h58m47s">And if you aren’t born, the feeling doesn’t arise. The feeling that is extinguished is completely affliction.</a>
00:58:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h58m54s">So, in summary, in the q Kuta view that the Buddha said,</a>
00:58:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h59m03s">What is the suffering and happiness seen through overcoming the Buddha? It is a characteristic.</a>
00:59:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h59m11s">They talk with feelings, and the suffering and happiness that the Buddha said are characteristic.</a>
00:59:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h59m17s">So, the feeling itself is a feeling of happiness, pain, hospitality,</a>
00:59:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h59m22s">Whatever it is, it is suffering in itself because it has an attribute and is included in it.</a>
00:59:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h59m30s">Then, if the feeling is somen, if the feeling is suffering, what will be the recovery?</a>
00:59:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h59m40s">This is complete happiness. So now the feeling of somen</a>
00:59:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=00h59m50s">Now, because the dog is inside a bird, the feeling is suffering and the disappearance of the feeling is happiness.</a>
00:59:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h00m02s">Then, let's try to summarize this a little bit and explain it a bit. So what we can know here is</a>
01:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h00m13s">In the buddha opinion meeting, seeing as happiness from the opinion in the bird is suffering.</a>
01:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h00m22s">It is evangelized in the words of Sol. From the standpoint of truth, people see suffering as happiness in 3</a>
01:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h00m30s">So, when I see suffering as happiness, how do I dance happiness while doing that?</a>
01:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h00m39s">I see suffering as happiness and happiness is important, so this is from the beginning, so there is a dog</a>
01:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h00m44s">It is very difficult to execute the cessation of suffering. Seeing suffering as suffering and happiness as a step, we must make efforts now.</a>
01:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h00m53s">Suffering can be extinguished from suffering, but happiness becomes suffering.</a>
01:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h01m00s">Because it was evangelized, so, in the eyes of the Buddha, seeing it as happiness and chasing it</a>
01:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h01m06s">That's why we say that this is a law of opinion</a>
01:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h01m13s">Even if you fold the opinion of the new introduction, it is evident from the standpoint of truth.</a>
01:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h01m21s">From the briber's point of view, suffering is viewed as happiness, so suffering causes suffering. Rather, suffering does not extinguish.</a>
01:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h01m31s">It's the pain that keeps you from getting out of suffering, your brain doesn't get out of you, and makes suffering happen.</a>
01:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h01m42s">If so, however, the Buddha's view sees this suffering as suffering and clearly sees happiness as happiness, so suffering leads to extinction.</a>
01:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h01m54s">So the pain</a>
01:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h01m58s">It is 4i that allows you to completely escape from suffering. So, if you have to say, this secular opinion now has a false concept</a>
01:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h02m08s">From a secular point of view, it can hardly be said that it is wrong, but from a dizzying standpoint, from this secular view</a>
01:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h02m17s">Speaking of suffering and happiness is a wrong view and a distorted view, this is the view that causes suffering</a>
01:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h02m25s">But, because from a brier's point of view, seeing suffering as happiness and asking dogs about happiness</a>
01:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h02m33s">It’s good, but the Buddha’s view is that the dog’s help is viewed as suffering</a>
01:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h02m39s">Because we see happiness as a walk as it is, so the Buddha’s opinion is pronounced</a>
01:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h02m45s">This is the view that leads to the cessation of suffering. So, this is the most difficult part when we practice Buddhism in this worldly view.</a>
01:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h02m55s">It’s the youngest to turn this view</a>
01:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h02m59s">Because it's distorted, what we're used to is what we think we are happy is actually suffering, but it keeps coming out</a>
01:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h03m07s">Because people go wrong with what they're used to, so they don't forget this, they keep insight into this as anguish and do this without obsessing over it.</a>
01:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h03m16s">This is what can be done, and this change of opinion is the most important thing in meditation.</a>
01:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h03m23s">That is why the conversion of disagreements is the conversion of awe for suffering and happiness.</a>
01:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h03m32s">Kelp beats 3 cows, seeing painful feelings as pain, feeling happy</a>
01:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h03m38s">The feeling of peace is viewed as happiness, but in this view, the feeling itself plays. So whatever you feel is the nature of suffering</a>
01:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h03m47s">You shouldn't tell the end of it because you're here. You can only be deceived by the feeling itself.</a>
01:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h03m56s">Rather, the feeling that the feeling doesn't happen and the feeling that disappears doesn't happen again is perfect happiness</a>
01:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h04m05s">This is the view of Buddha. So, after this view is converted, how can we understand</a>
01:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h04m14s">As I said before, feelings are inevitable because feelings exist and are in a relationship.</a>
01:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h04m25s">Then, this feeling itself is suffering, the hedgehog that being itself is suffering, such feeling is suffering.</a>
01:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h04m36s">And this feeling</a>
01:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h04m40s">Now, as the condition of phlegm, the Buddha said that because we have child phlegm, we will continue to be born and reincarnation continues. What is the condition for this phlegm?</a>
01:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h04m51s">Cucumber does this based on the feeling. So, if the feeling is not tied, the phlegm will disappear.</a>
01:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h04m59s">Now we said we're going to abandon the 4</a>
01:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h05m07s">This is called sputum, that is, sputum is thrown away, and when sputum is somen, mortality is realized.</a>
01:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h05m15s">Once the sputum is gone, now</a>
01:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h05m20s">Phlegm is just what it is, it can be ada ni, and when it is ada ni, if you are not tied to feelings, Seok will live with an experience.</a>
01:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h05m30s">We will not be born, but it is called our no nirvana. When this happens, the feeling of not being born again does not arise.</a>
01:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h05m37s">Then the feeling is completely extinguished, so this condition is the cessation of the suffering that the Buddha said</a>
01:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h05m44s">It can be said that it is the realization of happiness and complete happiness.</a>
01:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h05m52s">The way to get rid of sputum like this is to practice these 8 levels, so I know that the feeling itself is suffering.</a>
01:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h05m59s">It’s a clear insight for everyone. The feeling itself is no longer a bond of feelings that commanded insight into suffering, and then the sputum is said to be a sleeve.</a>
01:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h06m09s">It will now be like this with the cessation of suffering</a>
01:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h06m14s">2 In the end, even if you give a clear insight into the feeling through this</a>
01:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h06m22s">In fact, people who excel in wisdom are more complicated now feeling more</a>
01:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h06m29s">The insight of feelings even without talking Because only the insights of the feeling itself can eliminate suffering</a>
01:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h06m37s">So now, through the feeling, you realize the four-star sin and suffer completely from this 1</a>
01:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h06m44s">Such beings are those who are private among the Buddha's constant disciples, and now Magnolia Electronics.</a>
01:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h06m52s">So now the feeling is extinguished.</a>
01:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h07m00s">So, the season when we understand the suffering and happiness through the feeling that the adult is now feeling</a>
01:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h07m10s">I want to know that now, then I can get a sensitivity to how 4 wins and I work</a>
01:07:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h07m16s">It is possible to understand what is the right opinion and what is wrong, so through this feeling or testimony that is the first feeling</a>
01:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h07m28s">Once I understand the suffering and happiness, through the insight into this feeling, as I said earlier, this is now</a>
01:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h07m37s">Uh, we can understand the ejaculation system. After understanding the Mass,</a>
01:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h07m45s">Therefore, even through feelings, a wise person can gain insight into the fourth victory, but if this is a little insufficient now, this feeling is more general and all laws</a>
01:07:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h07m55s">We now take all the phenomena in this world into a more generalized way, and write all the laws in this world to the Buddha.</a>
01:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h08m05s">You classified it like this, but you said it as the law of material and score.</a>
01:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h08m14s">It’s not that difficult to understand the moving temple, so now, this time,</a>
01:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h08m23s">First, uh, there is a difference between the awe of the world and the Buddha's disagreement. Understanding how this difference is, and converting to overcoming it</a>
01:08:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h08m33s">It's important, that's what I want to talk about first, and the second</a>
01:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h08m40s">Through this feeling, it is pretty that we can understand that it is the Four Truths that we can understand about the Four Truths</a>
01:08:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h08m50s">In fact, wise people can break the Four Truths with just the feeling, but this is now based on this insight, and this feeling</a>
01:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h09m01s">The spirit of sacrifice, yes, it’s not during the law.</a>
01:09:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h09m08s">We can understand how the Four Truths Buddha explained this as the Four Truths.</a>
01:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h09m14s">So next time, I am now more general than I feel like the law, and through the law, how does the Buddha see all the phenomena in the world?</a>
01:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h09m25s">Let’s take a look at whether you have organized it in terms of suffering and happiness.</a>
01:09:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h09m32s">Oh, on the outside, there is something I left out of what I said earlier, so why might people think like this now</a>
01:09:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h09m40s">People feel happiness in this way because they think it is happiness when they write</a>
01:09:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h09m46s">So why is the cessation of feeling happy? There is nothing to say that the feeling is so good, but why is that happiness?</a>
01:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h09m55s">So, try to understand that the meaning of suffering and happiness that Bucheon Buddha said is a special machine. Then the feeling that the feeling was sleeved</a>
01:09:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h10m05s">What is felt is now the one that we exist, the feeling will arise, but the fact that this feeling is a state where the possibility of suffering is completely extinguished.</a>
01:10:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h10m15s">You know, this is because the variety that is painful by nature has completely disappeared.</a>
01:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h10m21s">It can be called happiness. So it is a little difficult if you understand this in a general sense.</a>
01:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h10m27s">So, if you check through the Buddha’s teaching,</a>
01:10:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h10m32s">Don't open page 65</a>
01:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h10m36s">When I see it off, I'll read it like a go-gel.</a>
01:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h10m45s">How do you say happiness when you don’t have it?</a>
01:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h10m54s">Cai What I'm saying here is that happiness is what we feel is usually happiness when we feel happiness in a secular sense,</a>
01:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h11m04s">Buddha's wash Even this is suffering. So, when this feeling disappears, the feeling is completely extinguished.</a>
01:11:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h11m15s">They see that the trait of suffering 1 trait completely extinct, this is now happiness. So this is happiness from the Buddha's point of view.</a>
01:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h11m25s">Because of that, if you understand that its characteristics are a little different from the secular view, this part is also difficult.</a>
01:11:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h11m33s">I can not understand</a>
01:11:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h11m39s">Now, it seems that there was a lot of content today</a>
01:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h11m46s">I checked it in 2 hours on the ride, so I talked a little bit together.</a>
01:11:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h11m59s">When I do, I talk about the four new methods of Shinsu.</a>
01:11:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h12m11s">Understanding is a very important point in our understanding of suffering and happiness.</a>
01:12:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h12m19s">That's because 2 If you understand this point well, it will be much easier to understand the 4 properties later</a>
01:12:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmLJWf6oUM#t=01h12m26s">So I understand that I vomited about my feelings, and yes, I will finish here today.</a>
