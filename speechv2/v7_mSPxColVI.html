<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h06m33s">There were no things like computers, certainly no PCs, that were room-sized things in those days</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h06m40s">and no one, no one had ever heard of such a thing. There were typewriters, of course</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h06m50s">I could see the light beneath them, some were blue, some red, some green.</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h06m56s">And I remember the man telling me, you are going to see these later in life.</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m06s">But you know, I had a meeting during this event with a man who came up to me and introduced himself as "Ben"</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m13s">He said he had come to be with me in this moment so I wouldn't have to go through this alone.</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m21s">And he told me all I needed to know after this experience was that there was nothing to worry about</a>
00:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m28s">Because I was hurt.</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m30s">I was injured and stuck in the car for 45 minutes.</a>
00:07:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m33s">But he had the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m37s">And was very sweet and called me by name from the beginning.</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m42s">He spoke very softly and lovingly and as soon as he touched me I relaxed completely.</a>
00:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m49s">But then as he got out of the car, he said; "I have to go now."</a>
00:07:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m52s">And smiled and dissolved into nothingness.</a>
00:07:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h07m56s">And I knew I had literally been touched by an angel.</a>
00:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m03s">I was in this state of consciousness</a>
00:08:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m07s">and that was with my soul and my spirit at this Source.</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m13s">I was no longer in my body at all.</a>
00:08:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m16s">I said well I surrender, take me, I am yours, I will do your job.</a>
00:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m22s">And I was immediately told, "no, it's not my job that you have to do, it's your job.</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m30s">Then I asked, "what's my job?"</a>
00:08:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m34s">Because I was in a place where all knowledge is known, and I could feel it</a>
00:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m38s">I assumed I would be told what my job is.</a>
00:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m44s">And, instead of being told, I was asked:</a>
00:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m46s">Well, what is it that keeps you from being whatever you can be?</a>
00:08:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m52s">Well, I didn't know because I thought everything was fine.</a>
00:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h08m57s">So I felt something about difference that kept my soul from connecting with the soul of another.</a>
00:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m06s">I didn't know how to bridge that gap.</a>
00:09:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m07s">And when I said this, in the light, in my conversation with God</a>
00:09:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m12s">then just like the most beautiful moment in the movie "Amadeus" when Mozart hits the perfect note and says "that's it"</a>
00:09:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m19s">The voice of God said to me, "That's it Lewis, that's your job.</a>
00:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m25s">And that was my conversation. I was then sent back all the way through the same tunnel and white light down.</a>
00:09:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m32s">Until I remember coming back into the body, and like those tight rubber gloves, it takes a while to sit.</a>
00:09:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m38s">And then, "pop," this white light disappeared.</a>
00:09:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m42s">And I'm in my car, a complete wreck, very badly damaged, without physical damage.</a>
00:09:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m50s">And I walk from the car to the ambulance and say, "Nothing wrong, there is no problem."</a>
00:09:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h09m57s">I was a young man in my early twenties, and I decided to come back here.</a>
00:09:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m01s">I wasn't done with why I was here.</a>
00:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m04s">I clearly remember squeezing myself, getting smaller and getting into my body.</a>
00:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m11s">It was as if I was hit back in the pain of this existence.</a>
00:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m16s">So I'll be back</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m17s">and at the time I was a student in mechanical engineering and physics.</a>
00:10:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m22s">I will come back and carry on with this life and career where they teach me Newton's physics.</a>
00:10:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m28s">They teach me that this 3D is it.</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m31s">And I am always from the beginning, from then on I am on the other side.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m35s">No no, there is all that other energy, there is all that other out here.</a>
00:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m43s">I don't specifically remember going into my body anymore.</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m47s">Besides that, you know, it was like going through a little funnel or something.</a>
00:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m54s">As if I was whizzing back into it.</a>
00:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h10m57s">And I heard the doctor say, "I thought for a moment we were going to lose her."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m01s">i tried to lift my arm</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m02s">and it felt so heavy</a>
00:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m05s">after being so light. It was so nice not to be in a body</a>
00:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m10s">because everything was so light and I could just go where I wanted to go without thinking about it.</a>
00:11:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m15s">And I tried to lift my arm and it weighed a ton</a>

00:11:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m25s">And then without any warning, as if someone threw me back into my body.</a>
00:11:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m33s">I regained consciousness about 90 seconds later</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m36s">back into my physical body.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m38s">I was pinned to the dash with my knee for 45 minutes.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m45s">About 20 minutes after the accident</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m48s">and after this guy disappeared I started to feel pain.</a>
00:11:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m53s">And my right foot, my knee, my arm was broken, my ribs were broken.</a>
00:11:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h11m58s">I remember the young woman who insisted on getting me out of the car</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h12m04s">and who was pulling the door and shouting at people to help her</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h12m23s">I started talking about it</a>
00:12:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h12m25s">and I was in the head injury ward.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h12m43s">Yes, but it is true! I have to explain it to him.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h14m34s">That is still not enough, if you put all the words together, to fully describe what I experienced</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h14m51s">Because it was more real.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m14s">I was lucky enough to be killed.</a>
00:15:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m16s">Think about what I'm saying. I was lucky enough to be killed</a>
00:15:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m20s">and then come back</a>
00:15:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m21s">so that I can say all this and know all of it.</a>
00:15:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m27s">Well, my feeling about Near Death Experience is about the same as when I hear about a paranormal experience or a mystical experience or any strange experience.</a>
00:15:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m36s">On the one hand, it is someone's real experience.</a>
00:15:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m40s">So, you have to listen to it carefully and compare it to other people's experiences.</a>
00:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m46s">Then the question is, if it's really strange, if it doesn't happen very often, then you have to figure out how to interpret what it means.</a>
00:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h15m54s">Some people interpret a Near Death Experience as meaning that they are literally separated from their bodies in some way.</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m00s">And their identification with who they are is no longer "this" but something else, spirit, soul, something like that.</a>
00:16:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m09s">It's been very difficult to do scientific research on these kinds of experiences because</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m14s">it is not ethical to induce such an experience.</a>
00:16:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m19s">And they mostly happen spontaneously, so it's hard to predict when they will happen.</a>
00:16:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m24s">On the other hand, there are examples of people who claim to leave their bodies and who can describe things correctly</a>
00:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m32s">from other positions, from other places.</a>
00:16:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m34s">That's when I get more interested because those things can be tested</a>
00:16:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m39s">and you don't have to have someone in Near Death Experience conditions to test it.</a>
00:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m44s">So what we have focused on, what my research mainly focuses on, is</a>
00:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m50s">people who are not 'nearly dead' but in a completely normal state</a>
00:16:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h16m54s">who, for example, are asked to describe something that is or has been hidden from a distance.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h17m00s">And we have pretty good evidence that humans can.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h18m43s">And by that we mean that you can obtain information remotely, in space or time.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h18m48s">The answer is: Yes, because we can do experiments to test whether that is possible.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h20m18s">You go to deeper and deeper levels of awareness of what is going on.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h35m06s">there was no way in physics to recognize this.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h35m10s">So, about 100 years ago, or a little bit longer, the idea of â€‹â€‹multiple dimensions arose</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h35m17s">and so people who do my kind of work suddenly became very interested in the possibility of other dimensions.</a>

00:35:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_mSPxColVI#t=00h35m56s">The calculations are much simpler if you are dealing with higher order dimensions</a>
