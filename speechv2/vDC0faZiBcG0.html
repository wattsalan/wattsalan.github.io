<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m02s">So, today we're gonna talk about Jung, and I find that tremendously entertaining</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m14s">I am not sure I've ever read anyone as intelligent as Jung</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m18s">Except, maybe Nietzsche.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m24s">It's funny, he is accused of many things, such as starting a new religion</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m28s">by some rather unscrupulous biographers</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m32s">But what he did was actually far more radical than anything he's ever been accused of.</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m36s">One other thing I should tell you too, is Jung is often been accused of antisemitism, but</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m40s">one of things that came into light last year, is that he was working as an agent for the American government during World War II</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m47s">and frequently set updates on</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m49s">Hitler's psychological condition to the highest levels of the American government</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m52s">He never told anybody about that</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h00m55s">So, you know, that's a little hard on the old accusations on antisemitism, I think</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m00s">which I never thought held any merit anyways</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m05s">So, Jung</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m10s">He (Jung) was a strange guy, in many ways.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m13s">Extraordinarily imaginative</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m18s">He could get lost in daydreams</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m22s">and was a tremendously powerful visualizer</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m26s">and a lot of what he discovered</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m31s">was a consequence of engaging in long-term elaborated fantasies</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m41s">and in these fantasies, he could have conversations with figures of his imagination</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m48s">and communicate with them.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m53s">I had a client at one point who was a very prolific dreamer and</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h01m58s">she can talk to her characters in her dreams and ask them what they meant symbolically and they would tell her</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m04s">That was really something</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m05s">I've only seen one person who was capable of doing that</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m10s">I don't know if it helped her that much, in the final analysis</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m13s">but she could do it</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m15s">Jung was very very interested in the depths of the human imagination</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m20s">his body of work</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m26s">can be viewed as an amalgam</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m28s">of many things, but</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m32s">he had deep knowledge of Latin and Greek</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m35s">and he had studied alchemical manuscripts</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m40s">for many many years as an older man</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m42s">so he was very interested in the emergence of the idea of science from what he considered the collective imagination</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m48s">but in many ways his primary modern intellectual influences, I would say, were</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m53s">Nietzche</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m55s">and Freud.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h02m58s">And Jung really set out, somewhat like Piaget,</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m05s">to address the gap between religion and science</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m09s">but he did it for different reasons than Piaget.</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m12s">Jung took Nietzsche's comments about the death of God very seriously</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m18s">and one of the things Nietzsche predicted at the end of the 19th century</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m23s">was that</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m25s">there were going to be two major consequences of the collapse of formal religious belief</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m30s">he believed that that would lead people to a morally relativistic condition</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m35s">that would prove psychologically intolerable</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m37s">because if you adopt a moral relativist position</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m41s">and you take it to its final conclusion</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m43s">then everything is of equal value and there's no gradient between things</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m48s">there's no better, and there's no worse.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m50s">And, in the final analysis, you might say, well, there's no good and there's no evil</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m54s">and the problem with that is you can't actually orient yourself in a world that has those properties</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h03m59s">because in order to act, as we've already talked about with regards to the cybernetic models,</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m05s">you have to be aiming at something that's better than what you have now</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m08s">or there's no reason to expend the energy</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m11s">and so you need the gradient, you need a value differentiation in order to act</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m15s">and Nietzsche's analysis</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m20s">was predicated on the idea that if the value hierarchy collapsed</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m24s">well not only would people not be motivated to do anything anymore</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m27s">but they would also be extraodinarily confused</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m31s">and depressed</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m31s">because the value would go out of their lives</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m33s">and the consequence of that would be that they would become somewhat nihilistic or maybe absolutely nihilistic</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m39s">or that they would turn to ideological, rigid ideological systems as a replacement.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m45s">Now, what Nietzsche offered as an alternative to that</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m50s">was that human beings could create their own values</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m53s">and so his idea was that the Superman, the Overman -- depending on how you look at it</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h04m58s">would be the person who is capable of transcending the valueless universe</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m05s">that the decline of religion had left with us</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m09s">and creating their own values as a conscious act.</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m14s">The problem with that is that it isn't obvious that you can create your own values as an conscious act</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m21s">because it's not obvious that values are consciously created</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m25s">And I think this is why the psychoanalysts had so much to add to the philosophical debate</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m31s">at least the philosophical debate that developed to the point of Nietzsche's observations.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m39s">When Freud entered the scene,</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m42s">the idea of the unconscious was in the air, but Freud formalized it to a much greater degree than anyone else had, and</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m48s">Freud's theory really is deeply biological</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m53s">it's biological, it's social as well,</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h05m56s">but his proposition, the proposition that there is an Id</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m00s">is fundamentally the proposition that you're not necessarily... Your consciousness, for sure, is not the master in its own house.</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m07s">Now, I think part of the reason that people like to go after Freud --there's a variety of reasons--</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m13s">but one of them is, that modern people basically accept radical Freudian presuppositions more or less as givens now</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m20s">So if you are a brilliant thinker and your thought permeates the society to the point where</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m25s">your most radical propositions are accepted by everyone, all that's really left are your errors.</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m33s">And so it's easy to concentrate on Freud's errors because we've already digested everything he had to say that was particularly profound.</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m40s">I don't imagine --perhaps I'm wrong</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m42s">but I don't imagine that there's anyone in this room to whom the news that</a>
00:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m46s">many of your motivations aren't conscious</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m50s">comes as a surprise.</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m52s">I mean, even psychologists have admitted that in the last 20 years</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m56s">They talked about the cognitive unconscious</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h06m59s">which I think is a real slight of hand maneuver to stop them from having to credit Freud with his discoveries</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m06s">and I also think that Freud's notion of the unconscious is far more sophisticated than the cognitive scientists' notion</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m13s">because Freud viewed the unconscious as a place that was bascially populated by fragmented personalities</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m20s">not cognitive schemes of one form or another or not processes</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m24s">but things that were like living beings.</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m26s">You know, you think, 'Well are the living beings in your unconscious?'</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m30s">And the answer to that is, well, 'are you alive or not?'</a>
00:07:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m33s">And you're alive so you're composed of living subcomponents</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m37s">and they're not machines, or at least not in any way that we understand machines</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m42s">They're fragmentary sub-personalities and each of them has their own worldview and rationalizations and emotional structure and goals</a>
00:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m51s">And so that's why when you're hungry you see the world through the eye of a hungry person and you think thoughts about food</a>
00:07:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h07m56s">And your emotional reactions depends on whether the food is available or whether it isn't</a>
00:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m01s">and maybe whether not the food you want is available and whether it isn't</a>
00:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m06s">and that's nature, so to speak, imposing its necessities on you as a living being.</a>
00:08:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m14s">For Freud, that was the Id</a>
00:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m16s">and Freud thought of the Id really as something that was primordial and primitive</a>
00:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m28s">and that was one of the things that really separated him from Jung.</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m31s">I think Jung is much more accurate from the perspective of evolutionary psychology</a>
00:08:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m36s">In fact, I think he's radically underestimated as a thinker whose thought was unbelievably deeply grounded in biology</a>
00:08:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m45s">and Jung was a remarkable person because</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m47s">his notion of history and the relationship between history and the human psyche</a>
00:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m53s">covered spans of time that were really</a>
00:08:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h08m58s">until modern historians and evolutionary psychologists started to talk about 'deep time'</a>
00:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m02s">and the fact that, you know,</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m04s">the entire 4-billion-year history of the world is in some sense relevant to us as beings</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m10s">or at least the 3-billion, 3.5-billion-year history that there's been life on the planet.</a>
00:09:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m16s">Ancient history for European philosophers was like 500 to 2000 years ago</a>
00:09:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m21s">and Jung thought way past that, way back farther than that.</a>
00:09:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m26s">and started to take into serious account the fact that the origins of our psyche, the ground of our psyche, is deeply biological</a>
00:09:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m33s">and that it's an emergent property, so</a>
00:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m35s">for Freud, Freud's idea of the unconscious is somewhat difficult to understand because there's sort of two elements to it.</a>
00:09:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m41s">There's the ID, which is the source of primordial motivation</a>
00:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m45s">and Freud concentrated mostly on aggression and sexuality</a>
00:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m49s">and the reason he concentrated on those two</a>
00:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m51s">--although he concentrated on what he called the death instinct later in his life--</a>
00:09:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m55s">the reason he concentrated on those two primarily</a>
00:09:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h09m58s">wasn't because he regarded them necessarily as the most compelling of motivations</a>
00:09:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m03s">but he regarded those motivations as the ones that were most difficult, for most people</a>
00:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m08s">to integrate successfully into the social world</a>
00:10:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m12s">So he thought that they were most likely to be repressed</a>
00:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m15s">and therefore underdeveloped and immature.</a>
00:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m20s">And I think that's that's a reasonable proposition</a>
00:10:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m24s">I think that modern people would have to add eating to that</a>
00:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m28s">because since the time of Freud we've gone, I would say, from a high proportion of sexually related pathologies</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m36s">to a very very high proportion of eating related pathologies</a>
00:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m39s">but that's in some sense beside the point.</a>
00:10:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m43s">So that's one part of the Freudian unconscious, sort of an implicit unconscious,</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m48s">and then the other part of the Freudian unconscious is those things that have happened to you that you've repressed</a>
00:10:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h10m54s">because you don't like what they imply.</a>
00:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m00s">And, you know, those are very different kinds of unconscious</a>
00:11:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m02s">because one of them is dependent on your experience and the other isn't</a>
00:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m06s">You can think of Jung, actually, as a deep archaeologist of the Id</a>
00:11:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m13s">And Freud though about the Id in sort of primordial terms</a>
00:11:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m17s">so his angry Id would be</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m23s">like a beast that's out of control</a>
00:11:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m27s">but Jung recognized that the unconscious was far more sophisticated, in many ways</a>
00:11:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m35s">than the conscious parts of your being.</a>
00:11:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m40s">And that it guided your adaptation in ways that you didn't understand</a>
00:11:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m45s">and that the ways in which it guided your adaptations and structured your understanding were universal,</a>
00:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m53s">hence biological,</a>
00:11:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h11m55s">and far more sophisticated than a somewhat primordial notion of biological drive might indicate.</a>
00:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m08s">One of the things that you might consider, for example, is that from the Jungian perspective</a>
00:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m13s">a lot of the forces that ancient people considered deities were personified representations of instinctual systems</a>
00:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m24s">so here's a way of thinking about it --and this is a way of thinking about the collective unconscious</a>
00:12:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m28s">which is Jung's, in some sense, replacement term for the Freudian Id.</a>
00:12:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m36s">So Mars, for example, was the god of war, Roman god of war</a>
00:12:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m41s">and you might say, 'well, what does it mean for there to be a god of war?'</a>
00:12:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m46s">or Venus as the god of love, actually of sexual attraction, more particularly</a>
00:12:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m53s">or of sexual possession, which is even a better way of thinking about it</a>
00:12:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h12m59s">And you say, 'well why would people conceptualize of those phenomena as gods?'</a>
00:12:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m06s">The Greeks said, for example, that the humans were the play things of the gods</a>
00:13:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m10s">No, that was Shakespeare! I'm sorry, that was Shakespeare who said that</a>
00:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m15s">Well, here's one way of thinking about it:</a>
00:13:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m18s">what's older, you or aggression?</a>
00:13:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m22s">And the answer to that is, well, you're 23</a>
00:13:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m25s">and the system that mediates biological aggression in mammals and their progenitors</a>
00:13:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m30s">is tens of millions of years old.</a>
00:13:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m35s">And if you think you control it, rather than the other way around</a>
00:13:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m41s">you're deluded about your central nature</a>
00:13:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m44s">Part of it is that you don't control it at all</a>
00:13:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m48s">What happens is that you never go anywhere where you need to use it</a>
00:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m53s">And so one of the things that happens to soldiers in wartime, for example,</a>
00:13:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m56s">is they go somewhere where they could use it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h13m58s">and out it comes, and the consequences of its emergence is so traumatic</a>
00:13:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h14m04s">that they develop Post-traumatic Stress Disorder because they observe themselves doing things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h14m08s">that are hyper-aggressive, that they could have never imagined that someone like them could have manifested.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h14m15s">And then you think, well, what about Venus as a goddess?</a>
00:14:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h14m19s">Well, if you fall in love with someone</a>
00:14:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h14m24s">is that a choice?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h14m26s">It doesn't look like a choice</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h17m27s">and they're actually at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy, and that's not the same as being depressed.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h18m30s">an anti-depressant is very unlikely to fix that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h18m48s">and maybe the anti-depressant will help you regain enough cognitive control so that you can plan your way out of the situation</a>
00:18:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h18m55s">but as a medication in and of itself, there's no possible way it can lift you out of those often catastrophically complex and disintegrating circumstances</a>
00:18:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m04s">Whereas, if your life is fine but you feel terrible,</a>
00:19:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m10s">well, it's much more likely that an anti-depressant can help with that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m28s">I would say, idiots say that you should have high self-esteem</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m32s">it's an unbelievably corrupt construct in many ways</a>
00:19:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m36s">because it's actually very very highly correlated with baseline levels of neuroticism, negatively,</a>
00:19:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m42s">which is a fundamental personality trait,</a>
00:19:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m44s">and baseline levels of extroversion</a>
00:19:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m45s">so someone with low self-esteem is generally someone who's introverted and has high levels of negative emotion,</a>
00:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m51s">it's a trait-like phenomena</a>
00:19:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m52s">It isn't clear at all that calling that low self-esteem has any utility whatsoever</a>
00:19:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h19m57s">But then you also might ask yourself, 'well, how much self-esteem should you have?'</a>
00:19:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h20m02s">Well, and that's a very complex question because you can clearly have way too much</a>
00:20:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h20m06s">That's what would make you a narcisist.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h20m09s">So I would say your self-esteem should be roughly equivalent to the esteem to which you're held by members of your society</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h20m19s">You know, your family and your society, because they're judging you, at least in part, on your competence.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h20m25s">And you shouldn't think that you're more competent than you are,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h20m40s">Now, I think it's complicated by the fact that you should also regard yourself not only as who you are</a>
00:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h20m47s">but as who you could be</a>

00:20:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h20m55s">because you're young and, you know, you're starting your lives</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h21m03s">should tilt the self-assessment balance in your favor, to a fair degree.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h21m13s">Anyways, Jung was very interested in the depths of the psyche</a>
00:21:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h21m17s">and for him the unconscious wasn't a repository of repressed experiences,</a>
00:21:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h21m25s">and it wasn't a repository of underdeveloped and irritated biological systems</a>
00:21:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h21m31s">It was instead the underlying structure of consciousness itself.</a>
00:21:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h21m37s">So Jung believed that human experience, as it's consciously manifested,</a>
00:21:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h21m45s">was structured by underlying patterns of behavior</a>
00:21:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h21m54s">that were specific and unique to humankind</a>
00:21:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m01s">although shared to some degree with other animals</a>
00:22:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m04s">And then on top that a realm of imagistic and symbolic representation</a>
00:22:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m10s">that in part was a consequence of representation of those underlying behaviors</a>
00:22:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m17s">So here's a way of thinking about it:</a>
00:22:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m21s">We act in a human way, whatever that means</a>
00:22:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m25s">and we've been acting in a human way for as long as there's been human beings</a>
00:22:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m29s">and we've been acting in a mammalian way for as long as there's been mammals.</a>
00:22:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m34s">Now, human beings are quite peculiar creatures because, not only do we act, we also watch ourselves act</a>
00:22:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m40s">and we represent those actions</a>
00:22:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m42s">And Jung believed that as a consequence of us manifesting a specific set of typically human behaviors over hundreds of thousands</a>
00:22:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m57s">--or perhaps millions of years--</a>
00:22:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h22m59s">we also evolved the cognitive apparatus that was capable of representing those patterns of behavior</a>
00:22:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m05s">and that cognitive apparatus expressed the representations of those fundamental patterns of behavior in imagistic and symbolic form</a>
00:23:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m14s">and the basic imagistic and symbolic form is something like drama.</a>
00:23:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m19s">Now, why would that be?</a>
00:23:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m20s">Well, it's obvious in some sense</a>
00:23:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m23s">What is drama?</a>
00:23:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m25s">Drama is the representation, the abstract representation, of patterns of behavior</a>
00:23:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m31s">That's what you do when you go to a movie</a>
00:23:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m33s">You watch people manifest their characteristic behaviors.</a>
00:23:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m38s">And then you might note that there is characteristic, quasi unique patterns of behavior that are portrayed in drama.</a>
00:23:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m47s">So, for example, there's the bad guy, and he wears a black hat in a cowboy movie</a>
00:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m52s">and whenever you go to a movie it's pretty clear to you right away who the good guys are and the bad guys are</a>
00:23:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h23m58s">and you accept the distinction between good and bad guys as an apriori acceptable distinction.</a>
00:23:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m05s">So Jung would say, 'well, that's the action of an archetype'</a>
00:24:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m07s">what underlies that is the archetypal story of the hostile brothers</a>
00:24:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m12s">and hostile brothers, for example, are Cain and Abel</a>
00:24:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m15s">The story of Cain and Abel in Genesis, by the way, is really the second story that's in that origin myth</a>
00:24:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m23s">and it's the first story about real human beings, right?</a>
00:24:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m27s">Because Adam and Eve, so to speak, were created by God, whereas Cain and Abel were born. The first brothers.</a>
00:24:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m34s">Well, what happened?</a>
00:24:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m35s">Well, one of them became insanely jealous of the other and murdered him.</a>
00:24:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m39s">So that's a pretty harsh story when you think that the monotheistic religions of the West, roughly speaking,</a>
00:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m49s">put as one of their foundational stories the idea that there is a twin pair of forces operating in the human psyche</a>
00:24:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC0faZiBcG0#t=00h24m57s">that can be conceptualized as brothers who are murderously opposed to one another</a>
00:24:57</p>
